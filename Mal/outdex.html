   <li>Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It's not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything.</li> 
   <br/>
   <li>Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.</li> 
   <br/>
   <li>If my mind can conceive it, and my heart can believe it - then I can achieve it.</li> 
   <br/>
   <li>I hated every minute of training, but I said, 'Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion'.</li> 
   <br/>
   <li>Don't count the days, make the days count.</li> 
   <br/>
   <li>Champions aren't made in gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them-a desire, a dream, a vision. They have to have the skill, and the will. But the will must be stronger than the skill.</li> 
   <br/>
   <li>I'm a fighter. I believe in the eye-for-an-eye business. I'm no cheek turner. I got no respect for a man who won't hit back. You kill my dog, you better hide your cat.</li> 
   <br/>
   <li>The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up</li> 
   <br/>
   <li>Hating people because of their color is wrong. And it doesn't matter which color does the hating. It's just plain wrong</li>
   <br/>
   <li>Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.</li> <br/>
   <li>The Service you do for others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth.</li> 
   <br/>
   <li>To be a great champion you must believe you are the best. If you are not, pretend you are.</li>
